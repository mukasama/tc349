<h1 align="center">5 Design Principles & Example</h1>  

<h3 align="center"> Good and Bad Affordance</h3>

<div id="a">
    <img src="img/Good Affordance.png" width="400" height="350" alt="G-AF" id="i1"><!--Image taken from http://www.paypal.com/-->
  <img src="img/Bad Affordance.png" width="400" height="300" alt="B-AF" id="i2"><!--Image taken from https://maps.google.com/maps/myplaces?dg=feature-->
</div>

<br >

<li>The image to the right shows a good use of Affordance. Paypal shows exactly what you are required to do. For example, it shows you where your email address and password should be entered, what buttons represent what to do. The use of color is also perfect as they are nice and clear. However, the image to the right shows a picture of google maps. There are no clear instructions on what is exactly happening here, it just shows a map with images on it. The user has to guess on how to navigate the page.</li>

<h3 align="center"> Good and Bad Chunking</h3>

<div id="a">
    <img src="img/Good Chunking.png" width="400" height="350" alt="G-CH" id="i1"><!--Image taken from http://www.amazon.com/-->
    <img src="img/Bad Chunking.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="B-CH" id="i2"><!--Image taken from http://www.med.unc.edu/pulmonary/specialties/areas-and-programs/lung-transplant-->
</div>

<br >

<li>One of the best websites that uses the chunking design principle is Amazon. Amazons, website displays excellent use of good writing. It puts pivotal content at the top of the page and its homepage is full of short, catchy messages. Subheadings are meaningful and use colored text for things they want to point out. The use of slang and extended metaphors is avoided. On the other end the website to the right does not illustrate these techniques as the pages are extremely long and lot of the important information is below. Paragraphs should be shortened down, as users don’t like to read a lot. The colors used are also basic it looks like the website is new and has just been created.</li>

<h3 align="center"> Good and Bad Single to Noise Ratio</h3>

<div id="a">
    <img src="img/Good Signal to Noise.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="G-STNR" id="i1"><!--Image taken from http://cartfrenzy.com/opera-ma-ge/-->
    <img src="img/Bad Signal to Noise.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="B-STNR" id="i2"><!--Image taken from http://www.ritzcamera.com/-->
</div>

<br >

<li>Signal to Noise Ratio is used in almost all websites. This is the ratio of relevant to irrelevant information in a display. The Ritz website to the right displays a bad use of single to noise ratio.  We see a lot of information on their homepage especially in the header, as it’s hard for the user to find what they are looing for since nothing stands out. It looks like text is competing with each other for attention and there is no room for it to breathe. On the other hand Opera on the left of the above picture makes a great use of whitespaces on its home page. Even though the text is in another language it is east to tell what the website is selling as you eye can easily navigate through the different parts of the page. Lastly page elements aren’t competing with each other.</li>

<h3 align="center"> Good and Bad Rule of Thirds</h3>

<div id="a">
    <img src="img/Good ROT.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="G-ROT" id="i1"><!--Image taken from http://www.websitemagazine.com/content/blogs/posts/archive/2011/06/02/web-design-amp-the-rule-of-thirds.aspx-->
    <img src="img/Bad ROT.png" width="400" height="350" alt="B-ROT" id="i2"><!--Image taken from http://www.ritzcamera.com/-->
</div>

<br >
<li>The rule of thirds is used in most online journals such as newspapers or social media sites. This means a technique in composition in which a medium is divided into thirds, creating aesthetic positions for design. It mainly focuses on how the information in organized on a webpage. For example the rolling stone image to the left is a perfect example. The websites homepage is split up into 9 squares each with a different purpose. This catches the users eye especially those that go on it everyday and know where the information they want to read it. On the other hand the image to the right shows a bad example for this. The two most important things are not used, clarity and distractions. Headlines do not include value propositions, there is no third party credibility indicator and low contrast text is used and therefore the text is reduces legibility. Lastly in terms of distractions the right to left eye flow is counter-intuitive.</li>


<h3 align="center"> Good and Bad Golden Ratio Rule</h3>

<div id="a">
    <img src="img/Good GR.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="G-GR" id="i1"><!--Image taken from http://beauty.goldenbeautymeter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GoldenRatioTwitter.jpg-->
    <img src="img/Bad GR.png" width="400" height="350" alt="B-GR" id="i2"><!--Image taken from http://www.lingscars.com/-->
</div>   

<br >

<li>The golden ratio rule is mostly used in images. This technique uses a ratio within elements of a form, such as height to width, approximating 0.618/1.618. The twitter image to the left shows a great example of this. Sections have been split up into different forms that way the users know where things are, he or she can view posts on the right and also make a post on the left at the same time. "There is something leading the eye from on point to another". However, the image to the right about ling’s cars is a terrible example. It is too bright, things are flashing everywhere and the user gets distracted on what is where. Most people can also get confused on what exactly the product being sold here is or they could think that this is a spam website and would never enter there credentials.</li>
