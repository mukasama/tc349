					ABC Farmers is a startup agricultural and animal farming company,
					that has a goal to promote agriculture towards the people of Uganda.

			<h1>Our Approach & Structure.</h1>

				<p>
					We ensure that farmers have the right tools, knowledges, techniques in order to prosper. Our goal is to help starting farmers become self-sufficient and be able to provide for their families. ABC Farmers also provides training on how to add more value to their products as we help them to become business-minded and rural entrepreneurs. Thus, contributing more towards the social and economic benefits to their community, country and maybe the continent.  
				</p>
			
			<h1>Other Resources</h1>

				<p>
				By connecting local farmers with international agencies we help farmers sell their products, send their children to school and reinvest in their land.
