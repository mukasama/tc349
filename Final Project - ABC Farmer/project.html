			  <h2>PETER MASSAWE - Potato Farmer</h2>
				<p>
				Peter is a potato farmer who lives in Masaka village, on the edge of Uganda’s Mabira Forest. For him, potato farming has proven to be the answer to his familys worries. Like countless other farmers living in the area, despite his hard work he rarely managed to harvest enough maize and beans to provide for all his family’s needs. Peter was desperate to use his farmland to earn a good living, and had heard about farmers from other villages making a profit from potatoes. But, as he told our project team, he needed some help to get started: “I decided to plant Irish potatoes because I knew they would fetch a good price, however I couldn’t plant them before because I didn’t have the seeds.” So when the opportunity arose to join a group of farmers in his village who were trialling potato farming, he seized it with both hands.

				<h2>SARAH KITENDA - Mango Farmer</h2>
				<p>
Farmers like Sarah have very little income to cover school and medical costs. Things changed for Sarah when she joined the ABC Farmers project in the area. Our
team trained Sarah in the best varieties of mango to grow and pruning techniques that would help her to grow more, high quality fruits. Sarah now harvests double
the number of mangoes from each tree and last season, for the first time, sold her fruit to the co-operative that ABC Farmers established nearby. Unlike other traders, the co-operative will buy mangoes of any size for a good price, as they use the fruits to make juice – helping Sarah earn much more than before. Although she also grows cowpeas, pigeon peas and green grams, mangoes are the most important source of income for Sarah. She told us: “mangoes can make a lot of money.”

			  <h2>DENNIS KAZIRO - Animal & Poultry Farmer</h2>
				<p>
				Dennis Kaziro has been a animal and poultry farmer since 2010. At his farm he has cow, goats, fish, pigs chickens and turkeys. Along with this he also has a small vegetation area that he produces tomatoes and cabbage from.  When he first started his business he had no capital at all. Two years later he join ABC Farmers, which he said has been a life changing decision for him. When people tour his farm, they are often most intrigued by the chickens and turkeys. Most are not surprised to look into the eyes of a cow or pig and bond with the animal, but many are surprised to learn that chickens and turkeys possess strong personalities, form friendships, and have a range of interests — which includes a deep fascination with many of the human visitors to his farm.
